I submit this repository as my Go-Learning homework, I inspired making this after watching **Who Am I** movie, anyway the android version was forked from AhMyth/AhMyth-Android-RAT with a lot of change, and I destroy the git history.

## Architecture

1. CoBat-Server, user-facing-command-center.py for dev/user hit, command-sender.go for sending command to deployed client
2. CoBat-Android, the android version
3. CoBat-PC, the pc version, only support windows

## Tech (in-order)
1. [Centrifugo](https://centrifugal.dev/) 
2. [Golang](https://go.dev)
3. Java
4. Python
